# DBMS: Airline Management - Bangkok Airways

In this Database Management System project, our team aims to study an airline business domain and design a database for the company of our choice which is Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited. The objective is to develop an organized system that enables business processes for an airline company like purchasing a ticket and transporting passengers to their desired destination. 

This airline database project consists mainly of two types of users:
1. **Passenger** : access the information such as flight schedules and purchase necessarily items to unable full-scaled services. 
2. **Employees**:  modify the information available in the system, and perform necessary tasks to support the business requirements. 

##  Case Study: Airline Core Business Process
1. Passengersâ€™ airline business including freight domestically and internationally 
2. Establishment of a public airport and/or operate and manage public airport, rent out space including other activities relating to the establishment and operation of the airport.

  
## EERD and Relational Schema
The final enhanced entity relationship diagram and relational schema can be view in the file *CSS325_sec1_gr5_FinalReport.pdf*, which is located in the folder *CSS325_sec1_gr5*

Specifically, the EERD is on the page 11 to 12 and the Final Relational Scheme is on page 25 to 26. 

## Files and Descriptions

2. **CSS325_sec1_gr5_Phase2M2_DML.sql** : This file can be used to insert the data into our database.
